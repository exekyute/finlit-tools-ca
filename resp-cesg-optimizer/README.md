# RESP + CESG Optimizer

> Projects a Canadian RESP year by year — contributions, CESG grant, and growth — toward a 4-year tuition target.

## What it does
- **RESP balance at age 18** — how much will actually be there for tuition.
- **Total CESG received** — free government grant captured.
- **Total contributions** — how much of your own money went in.
- **Tuition goal progress** — what % of your target the projection covers, with the exact shortfall or surplus called out.
- **Balance Growth Over Time** chart — line + stacked area showing contributions, grant, and growth.
- **"Whose Money Is It?" bar** — final balance split into your cash, government grant, and market growth.

## Why it's useful
- Enforces the $50K lifetime contribution cap and the $7,200 lifetime CESG cap.
- Implements the 16–17 special eligibility rule (most public calculators skip it).
- Nudges you toward the $2,500/yr sweet spot that captures the full $500 annual grant.
- Auto-saves; CSV export of the year-by-year schedule; printer-friendly.

## What it does NOT model

- Family-plan RESPs with multiple beneficiaries.
- Withdrawal phase / Educational Assistance Payments.
- Over-contribution penalties.
